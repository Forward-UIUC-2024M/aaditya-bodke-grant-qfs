       " {'description': 'Funding Opportunity Number: APS-620-14-000001  \\n\\nThe purpose of this notice is to announce an Annual Program Statement (APS) for the USAID/Nigeria Education Crisis Response. The overarching goal of the Education Crisis Response is to: Expand enrollment in appropriate, protective and relevant educational options for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria.Activities will provide targeted assistance for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria, and ensure that children and youth have continued access to an instructional routine in Adamawa and the buffer States of Bauchi and Gombe (with other States to be determined as needs require and conditions permit). Within this goal, the Education Crisis Response will address the following problems: Expected large increase in drop-out rates in affected States Over-crowding of classrooms and learning spaces due to influx of displaced populations Limited access for displaced children Shortage of qualified teachers and instructional materials for formal and non-formal education Children traumatized by violence and abductions, and families fear of sending their children to school Marginalization of girls and children with disabilities Rising tensions between host communities and displaced populations.Programs may have a maximum duration of 36 months. Priority will be given to applications that can be launched rapidly. USAID anticipates awarding approximately two to six awards ranging anywhere from minimum grant size of $300,000 and a maximum grant size of $15,000,000 made available either to one grantee, multiple grantees, or no grantees depending on the quality of the applications and availability of funds.Subject to the availability of funds, USAID intends to provide the funding in the total range of approximately $30,000,000. USAID/Nigeria reserves the right to make multiple grants, cooperative agreements, or no awards at all through this APS. Questions concerning this notice may be directed to Abdullahi Sadiq, USAID/Nigeria Assistance Specialist, at asadiq@usaid.gov with a copy to abujaeduprocurements@usaid.gov. Prospective applicants may not contact USAID technical staff directly for information on this APS such contact may be grounds for exclusion from the competition. Until the Grants/ and/or Cooperative Agreements are awarded, all communication between applicants and USAID must be directed through the Assistance Specialist.This notice does not obligate USAID to award a grant or cooperative agreement, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of applications.Deadline for submission of question for Round 1 was August 04, 2014. Deadline for submission of applications for Round 1 is: September 05, 2014.Prospective applicants are strongly advised to click the \"FULL ANNOUNCEMENT\" tab and download the APS and the APS Questions and Answers (Q&A) for full details.',\n",

Funding Opportunity Description \\nThis publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 and 2 C.F.R.   200.203. Any resultant award negotiations will follow all pertinent law and regulation, and any negotiations and/or awards for procurement contracts will use procedures under FAR 15.4, Contract Pricing, as specified in the BAA.\\n\\nThe Biological Technologies Office (BTO) is soliciting innovative proposals to develop beneficial, functional biofilms capable of reducing drag, decreasing corrosion, or inhibiting black mold growth on military material. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in microbial ecology, systems modeling, or community building. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in incremental improvements to the existing state of practice.\\n\\n1.1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW \\nBacteria are the most abundant and diverse lifeform on Earth, with the majority spending their lives in biofilms. This lifestyle is universally perceived as problematic since biofilms contribute significantly to equipment degradation, including Department of Defense (DoD) assets.\\n\\nHowever, biofilms do not have to be a problem. New insights suggest biofilms could be rendered beneficial by redirecting their composition and structure. Similar to the Arcadian vision of harmony with nature, the Arcadia program will develop \"probiotics\" for military material using microorganisms that naturally occur on DoD assets to build protective communities. These probiotics will generate robust and beneficial coatings that prevent corrosion, decrease drag, or inhibit the growth of black mold on DoD assets. Biofouling is a significant and ongoing challenge for the DoD. Biofilms form extensively on stored material, on aircraft and ship hulls, and in hard-to-reach places. Indeed, \"microorganisms can eat away at surface materials, and some of the worst areas affected are tight, hard-to-reach areas that maintainers have difficulty disinfecting1.\" In many cases, there is no simple remedy; the fouled surface or area cannot be easily accessed, as is the case for either the inside of fuel tanks or a deployed unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). Current DoD remedies (scrubbing, dry docking, and fuel-tank draining for repair) have significant, long-term limitations; they must be continually applied at great expense, yielding diminishing returns. Material fouling and degradation could be eliminated by harnessing the naturally occurring microbiota as \"material probiotics\" and providing protection from deleterious species. The Arcadia program will focus on four application tracks for specific DoD Concept of Operations (CONOPS): drag on UUVs, corrosion in or on UUVs, corrosion in fuel tanks, and black mold growth on DoD assets such as stored vehicles.\\n\\n1.2. TECHNICAL APPROACH AND PROGRAM STRUCTURE \\nArcadia will combat DoD asset degradation by generating \"material probiotics\"-biofilms with a beneficial function. Generation of such biofilms will be guided by rigorous modeling of species interactions with a greater focus on niche creation and interactions than on pairwise interactions. Model parameterization can be achieved through multiple sources; however, the performers must generate testbeds that non-destructively track communities so that reproducible, real-time data is acquired. The testbeds may leverage advances in micro- and milli-fluidics and must reproduce the target environment, including relevant disturbances, to the greatest extent possible. Information from the testbeds will feed back into the model, providing further validation and refinement. Testbed data will likely be complemented with high-throughput omics for a systems biology approach to downstream network analysis.\\n\\nAll possible strategies for functional biofilm generation will be examined. Example strategies include, but are not limited to: (1) \\'assembly,\\' where one starts with a single species and then adds new species in a stepwise fashion; and (2) \\'displacement,\\' where one starts with a stable community and then displaces a problematic species with a preferred one. Directed community management may also include transient invaders; programmed bacterial release of confounding quorum signals; antibiotics, antimicrobials, or enzymes for biofilm disruption and microorganism degradation; and incompatible extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) scaffold secretion to inhibit reseeding. While the use of genetically modified microorganisms is not a preferred strategy, they may be implemented to serve auxiliary functions to shape the community. If genetically modified organisms are used, performers must demonstrate a robust containment strategy and plan to seek and receive regulatory approval if needed to enable testing in the field, including the implementation of evolutionarily stable kill switches to limit such communities as well as the programmed die-off of engineered members of the community.\\n\\nAPPLICATION TRACKS \\nTo focus technology development, performers will choose one of four application tracks: (1) Drag on UUVs/Gliders; (2) Commercial UUV/Glider Corrosion; (3) Fuel-Tank Corrosion; or (4) Black Mold Inhibition. An individual proposal must address both Technical Areas (TA1 and TA2, described below) and must address only one application track. Performers wishing to address multiple applications should submit separate proposals for each.\\n\\nDescription of Tracks:\\nBiofilm samples from the relevant operational environments described below will be provided by Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) partners to performers at the beginning of the program, following completion of a material transfer agreement (MTA) with the IV&V team. In Phase II (24-month Option), IV&V testing of the communities in the field will be in conjunction with and coordinated by the IV&V team.\\n\\n  Drag on Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs)/Gliders Track:\\nBoth private and public entities employ UUVs in a broad range of applications, from environmental sampling to weather monitoring. As the technology advances, increased durability and deployment length are of chief concern. As UUVs/gliders transit from the surface to below HR001121S003939, Arcadia the photic zone for extended periods, biofilms often form from the marine organisms present within the water column. Biofouling on UUVs/gliders increases battery consumption via drag, similar to increased fuel usage of biofouled surface ships.2,3 This not only reduces UUV/glider deployment longevity, it also degrades their ability to navigate autonomously. Constant exposure to shear forces, shifts in the physical and chemical conditions between environments, nutrient availability, and the microbial ecology all influence the composition and stability of biofilms formed.\\n\\nPerformers must develop microbial mechanisms for decreasing drag on commercial UUVs/gliders and address the following track metrics:\\n  By the end of Phase I, laboratory-based testbeds must replicate disturbances experienced by UUVs including: changes in shear-rate stemming from a change in speed from stationary to 4 knots and, secondly, temperature shifts of 10 C. By the end of Phase II, temperature shifts should be 20 C.\\n  By the end of Phase I, decreased UUV/glider drag must be comparable to UUVs/gliders fouled by light slime, as indicated by the hydrodynamic roughness measure, ks < 300  m, outlined in Schultz et al., 2015.\\n  By the end of Phase II, decreased UUV/glider drag must be comparable to hydraulically smooth UUVs/gliders as indicated by the hydrodynamic roughness measure, ks < 150  m.\\n  Decreases in drag must not be accompanied by increases in other forms of fouling (e.g., increased corrosion).',\n",

Research efforts will leverage AFRL expertise and capabilities in materials science, chemistry, engineering, and biochemistry to target human performance monitoring, wearable devices, and responsive structures. Specific areas of interest include polymer synthesis, surface functionalization and on-demand actuation for the generation of dynamic materials. Candidates will have the opportunity to partner with experimental and computational scientists with the hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of material properties and identifying soft matter materials applications that assist the Air Force. Specific areas of interest include polymer synthesis, sequence specific materials, adaptable materials and organic material synthesis.

       " {'description': 'PURPOSE\\n\\nJDRF is committed to the development of beta cell replacement therapies to restore glycemic control and eliminate the need for exogenous insulin administration in people with T1D. Pancreatic islet transplantation has been efficacious in improving metabolic control, preventing severe hypoglycemia, and improving quality of life in patients with medically unstable T1D. Despite significant progress in the development of alternative renewable sources of insulin producing cells to overcome the shortage of donor tissue, major scientific and technical challenges remain that must be addressed before beta cell replacement is widely incorporated into the clinical management of established T1D. One key limitation is the need for systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs to protect the cell graft from the recipients immune response.\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nThe advent of the Edmonton protocol signified a major breakthrough in clinical islet transplantation by significantly improving outcomes in patients that underwent the procedure as reflected by stable glycemia, reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and elimination of hypoglycemia for several years.1,2 However, most of these patients still failed to maintain insulin independence for more than 5 years due to graft failure. Moreover, the use of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with serious adverse side effects and can impair beta cell function.3-5 Alternative approaches being explored for providing immune protection include encapsulation of cells in permselective membranes that allow exchange of nutrients, glucose, and insulin but block immune cells and other immune effectors from recognizing the graft.6-13 Although progress has been promising, the foreign body reaction and ensuing fibrotic encapsulation of implanted materials paired with limitations on mass transfer and nutrient delivery remain a challenge.\\n\\nMore recently, the emerging field of immuno-engineering has come to the forefront of efforts to develop technologies to control the patients innate and adaptive immune responses.14-24 These approaches employ various strategies targeting mechanisms of immune cell recognition and activation which could be exploited to direct the host response to implanted materials and/or cells towards a wound healing and/or tolerogenic response, as opposed to an inflammatory and/or effector response. Local immunomodulation at the graft site is highly desirable, as it could obviate the need for harsh and burdensome systemic immunosuppression regimens and perhaps even encapsulation barriers. Therefore, JDRF wishes to support research into novel strategies for localized modulation of the host response to implanted materials and development of immunomodulatory therapeutics to provide graft protection at the transplant site leading to long-term graft function.',\n",
