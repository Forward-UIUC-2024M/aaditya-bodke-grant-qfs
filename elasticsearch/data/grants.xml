The purpose of this notice is to announce an Annual Program Statement (APS) for the USAID/Nigeria Education Crisis Response. The overarching goal of the Education Crisis Response is to: Expand enrollment in appropriate, protective and relevant educational options for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria.Activities will provide targeted assistance for the girls, boys, and youth that are affected by violence in Northeastern Nigeria, and ensure that children and youth have continued access to an instructional routine in Adamawa and the buffer States of Bauchi and Gombe (with other States to be determined as needs require and conditions permit). Within this goal, the Education Crisis Response will address the following problems: Expected large increase in drop-out rates in affected States Over-crowding of classrooms and learning spaces due to influx of displaced populations Limited access for displaced children Shortage of qualified teachers and instructional materials for formal and non-formal education Children traumatized by violence and abductions, and families fear of sending their children to school Marginalization of girls and children with disabilities Rising tensions between host communities and displaced populations.Programs may have a maximum duration of 36 months. Priority will be given to applications that can be launched rapidly. USAID anticipates awarding approximately two to six awards ranging anywhere from minimum grant size of $300,000 and a maximum grant size of $15,000,000 made available either to one grantee, multiple grantees, or no grantees depending on the quality of the applications and availability of funds.Subject to the availability of funds, USAID intends to provide the funding in the total range of approximately $30,000,000.

However, the FFRDC's sponsoring agency must first make a determination that the effort being proposed falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC, and that determination must be included in the FFRDC's proposal. In addition, AFRL must make a determination that the work proposed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry. Only after these determinations are made, would a determination be made concerning the FFRDC's eligibility to receive
an award.

    <description>**Fund for Gender Equality**

In Canada today, too many women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse individuals still face barriers and discrimination of all kinds. To create communities of true belonging, we need to advance gender equality across the country.

We know that investing in women is not just the right thing to do, it is a strategic choice. By funding women-led and women-serving organizations, we can deliver double the impact-support decent work for female staff at these nonprofits and support the programming that serves women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people.

**Why now? **

-    2020 is a landmark year for gender equality around the world:
-    25 years since UN Women's Beijing Declaration and Action Plan, the most progressive global blueprint to advance women s rights
-    5 year milestone of the adoption of the UN s Sustainable Development Goals
-    For a just recovery from the pandemic, it is more pressing than ever to invest in women, girls, Two-Spirit people and gender-diverse people.
-    The work is necessary and the time is now. 
-    About the collaboration between community foundations, the Equality Fund and the Government of Canada

-    In 2019, CFC became one of the founding partners of the Equality Fund, a groundbreaking collaboration that will deliver new momentum for women s movements in Canada and around the world. 
-    As part of the collaboration, CFC and the Equality Fund have developed a five-year initiative to advance gender equality in Canada with support from the Government of Canada. 
-    Participating community foundations in this new initiative are not only undertaking grantmaking activities to support local organizations, but also examining their own institutional and investing practices to advance gender equality.

Grants can be used for a variety of purposes, including to pilot new initiatives, to address long-standing community needs, or to support a just recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. The initiatives themselves may touch on a wide range of areas that are affected by gender equality, including food insecurity, income inequality, racial injustice, domestic violence, and many more.</description>
    <eligibility>**Eligible applicants **
The Fund for Gender Equality will support projects led by qualified donees that are at the 'heart' of the women s movement-with those organizations that have demonstrated a long-term commitment to empowering women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people through their mission, activities, or partnerships.

The Fund prioritizes organizations that are  self-led  those that are led by the same groups that they focus on serving (for ex., led by immigrant women, led by Indigenous women, led by survivors of domestic violence, led by members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, etc.).

In the interest of ensuring the broadest possible reach, the Fund for Gender Equality will make only one grant per qualified donee. Exceptions may be made if the qualified donee is partnering with a non-qualified donee on an additional, distinct project.
**Can other kinds of organizations apply?**

**Non-Qualified Donees:** Many groups that work to advance gender equality are not qualified donees. Registered non-profits and other organizations that are at the heart of the women's movement are welcome to partner with a qualified donee to apply to the Fund for Gender Equality.

In the case of such a partnership:
-      The qualified donee would be the  Applicant Organization , listed first on the application.
-    That organization would be responsible for receiving the grant on behalf of the partnership.
-      The non-qualified donee partner organization would be the  Project Lead Organization 
-    and would be listed as such in the application
-      As part of the application process, the organizations would be required to sign and upload an Intermediary Agreement. The form for the agreement can be downloaded here.

Organizations with a primary focus other than gender equality: These organizations are not eligible to apply for a grant from the Fund for Gender Equality.</eligibility>

(10) Proposers with a Government acceptable accounting system who are proposing a cost-type contract must submit the DCAA document approving the cost accounting system.
Per FAR 15.403-4, certified cost or pricing data shall be required if the proposer is seeking a procurement contract award per the referenced threshold, unless the proposer requests and is granted an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data. Certified cost or pricing data" are not required if the proposer proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).
Subawardee Proposals The awardee is responsible for compiling and providing all subawardee proposals for the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO)/Grants Officer (GO)/Agreements Officer (AO), as applicable. Subawardee proposals should include Interdivisional Work Transfer Agreements (ITWA) or similar arrangements. Where the effort consists of multiple portions which could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options with separate cost estimates for each.
All proprietary subawardee proposal documentation, prepared at the same level of detail as that required of the awardee's proposal and which cannot be uploaded with the proposed awardee's proposal, shall be provided to the Government either by the awardee or by the subawardee organization when the proposal is submitted. Subawardee proposals submitted to the Government by the proposed subawardee should be submitted via e-mail to the address in Section I.
Other Transaction (OT) Requests All proposers requesting an OT must include a detailed list of milestones for each phase of the program (I, II, and III). Each milestone must include the following:
  milestone description,   completion criteria,   due date, and
  payment/funding schedule (to include, if cost share is proposed, awardee and Government share amounts).
It is noted that, at a minimum, milestones should relate directly to accomplishment of program technical metrics as defined in the BAA and/or the proposer's proposal. Agreement type, expenditure or fixed-price based, will be subject to negotiation by the Agreements Officer. Do not include proprietary data.</submission_info>

1. Funding Opportunity Description 
This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 and 2 C.F.R.   200.203. Any resultant award negotiations will follow all pertinent law and regulation, and any negotiations and/or awards for procurement contracts will use procedures under FAR 15.4, Contract Pricing, as specified in the BAA.

The Biological Technologies Office (BTO) is soliciting innovative proposals to develop beneficial, functional biofilms capable of reducing drag, decreasing corrosion, or inhibiting black mold growth on military material. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in microbial ecology, systems modeling, or community building. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in incremental improvements to the existing state of practice.

1.1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
Bacteria are the most abundant and diverse lifeform on Earth, with the majority spending their lives in biofilms. This lifestyle is universally perceived as problematic since biofilms contribute significantly to equipment degradation, including Department of Defense (DoD) assets.

However, biofilms do not have to be a problem. New insights suggest biofilms could be rendered beneficial by redirecting their composition and structure. Similar to the Arcadian vision of harmony with nature, the Arcadia program will develop "probiotics" for military material using microorganisms that naturally occur on DoD assets to build protective communities. These probiotics will generate robust and beneficial coatings that prevent corrosion, decrease drag, or inhibit the growth of black mold on DoD assets. Biofouling is a significant and ongoing challenge for the DoD. Biofilms form extensively on stored material, on aircraft and ship hulls, and in hard-to-reach places. Indeed, "microorganisms can eat away at surface materials, and some of the worst areas affected are tight, hard-to-reach areas that maintainers have difficulty disinfecting1." In many cases, there is no simple remedy; the fouled surface or area cannot be easily accessed, as is the case for either the inside of fuel tanks or a deployed unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). Current DoD remedies (scrubbing, dry docking, and fuel-tank draining for repair) have significant, long-term limitations; they must be continually applied at great expense, yielding diminishing returns. Material fouling and degradation could be eliminated by harnessing the naturally occurring microbiota as "material probiotics" and providing protection from deleterious species. The Arcadia program will focus on four application tracks for specific DoD Concept of Operations (CONOPS): drag on UUVs, corrosion in or on UUVs, corrosion in fuel tanks, and black mold growth on DoD assets such as stored vehicles.

1.2. TECHNICAL APPROACH AND PROGRAM STRUCTURE 
Arcadia will combat DoD asset degradation by generating "material probiotics"-biofilms with a beneficial function. Generation of such biofilms will be guided by rigorous modeling of species interactions with a greater focus on niche creation and interactions than on pairwise interactions. Model parameterization can be achieved through multiple sources; however, the performers must generate testbeds that non-destructively track communities so that reproducible, real-time data is acquired. The testbeds may leverage advances in micro- and milli-fluidics and must reproduce the target environment, including relevant disturbances, to the greatest extent possible. Information from the testbeds will feed back into the model, providing further validation and refinement. Testbed data will likely be complemented with high-throughput omics for a systems biology approach to downstream network analysis.

All possible strategies for functional biofilm generation will be examined. Example strategies include, but are not limited to: (1) 'assembly,' where one starts with a single species and then adds new species in a stepwise fashion; and (2) 'displacement,' where one starts with a stable community and then displaces a problematic species with a preferred one. Directed community management may also include transient invaders; programmed bacterial release of confounding quorum signals; antibiotics, antimicrobials, or enzymes for biofilm disruption and microorganism degradation; and incompatible extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) scaffold secretion to inhibit reseeding. While the use of genetically modified microorganisms is not a preferred strategy, they may be implemented to serve auxiliary functions to shape the community. If genetically modified organisms are used, performers must demonstrate a robust containment strategy and plan to seek and receive regulatory approval if needed to enable testing in the field, including the implementation of evolutionarily stable kill switches to limit such communities as well as the programmed die-off of engineered members of the community.

APPLICATION TRACKS 
To focus technology development, performers will choose one of four application tracks: (1) Drag on UUVs/Gliders; (2) Commercial UUV/Glider Corrosion; (3) Fuel-Tank Corrosion; or (4) Black Mold Inhibition. An individual proposal must address both Technical Areas (TA1 and TA2, described below) and must address only one application track. Performers wishing to address multiple applications should submit separate proposals for each.

Description of Tracks:
Biofilm samples from the relevant operational environments described below will be provided by Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) partners to performers at the beginning of the program, following completion of a material transfer agreement (MTA) with the IV&amp;V team. In Phase II (24-month Option), IV&amp;V testing of the communities in the field will be in conjunction with and coordinated by the IV&amp;V team.

  Drag on Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs)/Gliders Track:
Both private and public entities employ UUVs in a broad range of applications, from environmental sampling to weather monitoring. As the technology advances, increased durability and deployment length are of chief concern. As UUVs/gliders transit from the surface to below HR001121S003939, Arcadia the photic zone for extended periods, biofilms often form from the marine organisms present within the water column. Biofouling on UUVs/gliders increases battery consumption via drag, similar to increased fuel usage of biofouled surface ships.2,3 This not only reduces UUV/glider deployment longevity, it also degrades their ability to navigate autonomously. Constant exposure to shear forces, shifts in the physical and chemical conditions between environments, nutrient availability, and the microbial ecology all influence the composition and stability of biofilms formed.

Performers must develop microbial mechanisms for decreasing drag on commercial UUVs/gliders and address the following track metrics:
  By the end of Phase I, laboratory-based testbeds must replicate disturbances experienced by UUVs including: changes in shear-rate stemming from a change in speed from stationary to 4 knots and, secondly, temperature shifts of 10 C. By the end of Phase II, temperature shifts should be 20 C.
  By the end of Phase I, decreased UUV/glider drag must be comparable to UUVs/gliders fouled by light slime, as indicated by the hydrodynamic roughness measure, ks &lt; 300  m, outlined in Schultz et al., 2015.
  By the end of Phase II, decreased UUV/glider drag must be comparable to hydraulically smooth UUVs/gliders as indicated by the hydrodynamic roughness measure, ks &lt; 150  m.
  Decreases in drag must not be accompanied by increases in other forms of fouling (e.g., increased corrosion).</description>
    <eligibility>3.1. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS 
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.

3.1.1. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government Entities 
FFRDCs 
FFRDCs are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this solicitation in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions. (1) FFRDCs must clearly demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector. (2) FFRDCs must provide a letter, on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization, that (a) cites the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry, and (b) certifies the FFRDC s compliance with the associated FFRDC sponsor agreement s terms and conditions. These conditions are a requirement for FFRDCs proposing to be awardees or subawardees.

Government Entities 
Government Entities (e.g., Government/National laboratories, military educational institutions, etc.) are subject to applicable direct competition limitations. Government Entities must clearly demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant, establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry. This information is required for Government Entities proposing to be awardees or subawardees.

Authority and Eligibility 
At the present time, DARPA does not consider 15 U.S.C.   3710a to be sufficient legal authority to show eligibility. While 10 U.S.C.  2539b may be the appropriate statutory starting point for some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility. DARPA will consider FFRDC and Government Entity eligibility submissions on a case-by-case basis; however, the burden to prove eligibility for all team members rests solely with the proposer.

3.1.2. Non-U.S. Organizations 
Non-U.S. organizations and/or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary nondisclosure agreements, security regulations, export control laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.</eligibility>

    <description>The ability to synthetically tailor the molecular structure and chemical architecture of functional materials provides an opportunity to meet many Air Force application needs. Agile synthetic platforms are desirable for research tasks related to organic sensors, adhesives, and stimuli-responsive materials. Furthermore, incorporation of these systems into flexible devices remains vital to their long term success on the battlefield. Research efforts will leverage AFRL expertise and capabilities in materials science, chemistry, engineering, and biochemistry to target human performance monitoring, wearable devices, and responsive structures. Specific areas of interest include polymer synthesis, surface functionalization and on-demand actuation for the generation of dynamic materials. Candidates will have the opportunity to partner with experimental and computational scientists with the hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of material properties and identifying soft matter materials applications that assist the Air Force. Specific areas of interest include polymer synthesis, sequence specific materials, adaptable materials and organic material synthesis. Furthermore, there remains interest in incorporating machine learning methods into synthesis and material properties studies, as well as using continuous flow chemistry to synthesize materials and macromolecules.

Level: Open to Postdoctoral and Senior applicants

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**   

Qualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to race, creed, color, age, sex, or national origin.  

**Education and Experience -** Applicants must have earned a Ph.D., Sc.D., M.D., D.V.M., or academically equivalent research doctorate before beginning tenure.  

**Level -** The Fellowships Office makes NRC Research Associateship awards at the postdoctoral and senior researcher level.  

-  **Postdoctoral Associateships** \- Applicants must have held the doctorate for less than five years as of the application deadline.
-  **Senior Associateships** \- Applicants will have held the doctorate five years or more as of the application deadline or will hold a permanent appointment in academia, government, or industry and have research experience that has resulted in significant contributions and recognition as established investigators in their specialized fields. Applicants should check the detail of the particular program to which they are applying to determine if senior applicants are accepted. 

**Current or Prior Affiliation with the Laboratory -** A primary objective of the NRC Research Associateship Programs is to provide a mechanism for new ideas, knowledge, and skills to be brought to the sponsoring laboratory. Persons with current or recent prior affiliation with a sponsoring agency to which they wish to apply may not be eligible for an award.   

Disqualifying current or prior affiliation includes direct employment relationships either with the agency or with a contractor whose work is performed at the agency; individuals who hold or have held other postdoctoral fellowships which are sponsored by or conducted at agency laboratories are also considered ineligible.   

Generally, research performed in collaboration with scientists at a sponsoring federal agency/laboratory as a student, postdoc, or faculty member is not considered to be disqualifying for an applicant to the same agency unless the proposed research involves continuation of work with the same Research Adviser or on the same or similar project. If you are uncertain of your eligibility, please confirm it with the Agency and the Fellowships Office ([rap@nas.edu](mailto:rap@nas.edu)) prior to submitting your application.  

**Citizenship and Immigration Status -** Citizenship requirements for the NRC Research Associateship Programs vary depending on the sponsoring federal laboratory. Refer to the citizenship requirements of the agency to which you are applying. 

-  [View visa options for non-U.S. citizens](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/RAP/PGA_056324)

**Security Review/Security Clearance - Each agency has specific procedures for new Associates to gain access to laboratory facilities.** Some awards are contingent upon the satisfactory completion of a National Agency Check (NAC) or other clearance processes. An unsatisfactory result from the investigation is cause to withdraw the Associateship award offer. For laboratories that accept applications from non-resident aliens (foreign nationals) clearance processes may require prior residence in the U.S. for a period of up to three years. Foreign nationals should discuss security requirements with the prospective Research Adviser and/or agency program manager.  </eligibility>

    <description>PURPOSE

JDRF is committed to the development of beta cell replacement therapies to restore glycemic control and eliminate the need for exogenous insulin administration in people with T1D. Pancreatic islet transplantation has been efficacious in improving metabolic control, preventing severe hypoglycemia, and improving quality of life in patients with medically unstable T1D. Despite significant progress in the development of alternative renewable sources of insulin producing cells to overcome the shortage of donor tissue, major scientific and technical challenges remain that must be addressed before beta cell replacement is widely incorporated into the clinical management of established T1D. One key limitation is the need for systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs to protect the cell graft from the recipients immune response.

BACKGROUND

The advent of the Edmonton protocol signified a major breakthrough in clinical islet transplantation by significantly improving outcomes in patients that underwent the procedure as reflected by stable glycemia, reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and elimination of hypoglycemia for several years.1,2 However, most of these patients still failed to maintain insulin independence for more than 5 years due to graft failure. Moreover, the use of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with serious adverse side effects and can impair beta cell function.3-5 Alternative approaches being explored for providing immune protection include encapsulation of cells in permselective membranes that allow exchange of nutrients, glucose, and insulin but block immune cells and other immune effectors from recognizing the graft.6-13 Although progress has been promising, the foreign body reaction and ensuing fibrotic encapsulation of implanted materials paired with limitations on mass transfer and nutrient delivery remain a challenge.

More recently, the emerging field of immuno-engineering has come to the forefront of efforts to develop technologies to control the patients innate and adaptive immune responses.14-24 These approaches employ various strategies targeting mechanisms of immune cell recognition and activation which could be exploited to direct the host response to implanted materials and/or cells towards a wound healing and/or tolerogenic response, as opposed to an inflammatory and/or effector response. Local immunomodulation at the graft site is highly desirable, as it could obviate the need for harsh and burdensome systemic immunosuppression regimens and perhaps even encapsulation barriers. Therefore, JDRF wishes to support research into novel strategies for localized modulation of the host response to implanted materials and development of immunomodulatory therapeutics to provide graft protection at the transplant site leading to long-term graft function.</description>

    <description>The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is excited to announce the continuation of the No Child Left Inside Grant Program.

Recent and emerging research indicates that students are increasingly disconnected from nature. Getting more people into the outdoors is crucial for the future stewardship of Minnesota's natural resources.

**Purpose**
The program aims to support and increase efforts to expand programming that connects youth to the outdoors. Funded by the 2019 Minnesota Legislature with additional funding from the 2021 legislative session, these grants are provided for:

"outdoor environmental, ecological, and other natural-resource-based education and recreation programs serving youth."

(See [2019 Special Session 1, Chapter 4, Article 1, Section 3, Subd. 6](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2019/cite/84.976))</description>
    <eligibility>Activities for which grant dollars cannot be used include but are not limited to:

- Purchase of hunting or fishing licenses, tags or stamps;
- Group banquets, raffle prizes or other fundraising activities;
- Hunting and fishing competitions with cash awards or prizes larger than nominal value;
- Firearms and ammunition are not eligible (bows and arrows are eligible);
- Gardening for food projects, unless combined with significant agricultural or environmental education programming, including the benefits of local, healthy food programs;
- For-profit projects;
- Shooting range fees and clay targets;
- Annual field days or festivals;
- Capital equipment and fixed assets  such as vehicles, motorized boats, ATVs, snowmobiles, large ice fishing houses, trailers, sheds, shelters, platforms, greenhouses, computer equipment and other larger capital equipment or items (small canoes, kayaks, portable ice shelters and bicycles are eligible);
- Trail or nature area purchase, development, equipment or maintenance (related planning and training are eligible); and
- Administrative costs, such as overhead, insurance or indirect costs.

**Eligible applicants**
Applicants must be a public entity or private nonprofit organization with a mission or educational purpose that supports natural resource education and/or outdoor recreation.

The 2023 grants will consist of two types of grant awards - mini grants and larger grants. Applicants must choose only one.

**Mini grants**
Mini grants, with awards between $500-$5,000, will include a simple application and projects with smaller scope. Eligible projects will be entered into a lottery, and awards granted randomly on a [regionally-balanced statewide basis](https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fish_wildlife/outreach/r3/grants/nochild/ncli_map.pdf?20221118-40).

**Examples of eligible applicants**
Examples of organizations that would qualify include:

-    Public entities (cities, counties, special purpose districts and public schools, including public colleges and higher education institutions);
-    Native American tribes, schools or governments;
-    Non-profit organizations, including:
    -    Informal, after school and early childhood programs
    -    Community-based youth programs
Private businesses, state and federal agencies, and other applicants who do not meet these criteria are not eligible for this grant program.

The DNR reserves the right to restrict awards to a maximum of one per program, project, site or facility.

**Grant priorities**
The 2021 Legislature established some specific requirements and priorities for the No Child Left Inside Grant Program. The DNR has established additional funding priorities in consultation with stakeholders. Priorities and requirements for past phases were as follows:

-    Programs that maximize the number of participants, especially from new and diverse audiences with limited opportunities.
-    Audience must be youth (under 18) - activities that include participant families are also eligible.
-    Applicants commit matching funds or in-kind resources.
-    Projects that are community-focused with an ongoing impact rather than one-time events.
-    New and innovative programming (if an existing program or project, applicant must demonstrate a significant expansion in scope or inclusion of new audiences).
-    Projects must provide students direct experiences and understanding of nature.
-    Provide opportunities for outdoor recreation or to learn new outdoor skills.
-    Use public parks and other natural resource venues and personnel as resources.
-    Education classes that are held outside and use established environmental, ecological, agricultural or natural-resource educational curriculum.
-    Other projects that support natural resource education and outdoor recreation as determined by the DNR.</eligibility>
