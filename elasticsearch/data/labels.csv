693220,Gender Equality Grant,Advance gender equality across the Canada and may touch on a wide range of areas that are affected by gender equality including food insecurity income inequality racial injustice domestic violence and many more.
693222,Department of Defense DARPA - Biological Technologies Office - Arcadia Drag on Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs)/Gliders Track,develop "probiotics" for military material using microorganisms that naturally occur on DoD assets to build protective communities. These probiotics will generate robust and beneficial coatings that prevent corrosion decrease drag or inhibit the growth of black mold on DoD assets. Biofouling is a significant and ongoing challenge for the DoD. Biofilms form extensively on stored material on aircraft and ship hulls and in hard-to-reach places. The Arcadia program will focus on four application tracks for specific DoD Concept of Operations (CONOPS): drag on UUVs, corrosion in or on UUVs, corrosion in fuel tanks, and black mold growth on DoD assets such as stored vehicles.
693223,Jewish Community Foundation Next Stage Grants,Next Stage Grants are capacity building grants designed to support a dynamic and thriving Los Angeles Jewish community by strengthening the internal and operational capacity of local Jewish nonprofits. Bring to the forefront core and emergent capacity needs emphasized in recent conversations with nonprofits and capacity building experts
295528,Enabling Tailorable Material Properties with Synthetic Methods,The ability to synthetically tailor the molecular structure and chemical architecture of functional materials provides an opportunity to meet many Air Force application needs. Agile synthetic platforms are desirable for research tasks related to organic sensors, adhesives, and stimuli-responsive materials. Furthermore, incorporation of these systems into flexible devices remains vital to their long term success on the battlefield. Research efforts will leverage AFRL expertise and capabilities in materials science, chemistry, engineering, and biochemistry to target human performance monitoring, wearable devices, and responsive structures. Specific areas of interest include polymer synthesis, surface functionalization and on-demand actuation for the generation of dynamic materials. Candidates will have the opportunity to partner with experimental and computational scientists with the hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of material properties and identifying soft matter materials applications that assist the Air Force. Specific areas of interest include polymer synthesis, sequence specific materials, adaptable materials and organic material synthesis. Furthermore, there remains interest in incorporating machine learning methods into synthesis and material properties studies, as well as using continuous flow chemistry to synthesize materials and macromolecules.
276344,Localized Immunomodulation in Beta Cell Replacement- Pilot and Feasibility (PNF),Support research into novel strategies for localized modulation of the host response to implanted materials and development of immunomodulatory therapeutics to provide graft protection at the transplant site leading to long-term graft function. the emerging field of immuno-engineering has come to the forefront of efforts to develop technologies to control the patients innate and adaptive immune responses. These approaches employ various strategies targeting mechanisms of immune cell recognition and activation which could be exploited to direct the host response to implanted materials and/or cells towards a wound healing and/or tolerogenic response as opposed to an inflammatory and/or effector response.
